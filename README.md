# A questionable analysis of human gastrulation single cell RNA-seq data and mouse pluripotency bulk mRNA-seq data
Are you interested in joining the [Cambridge Stem Cell Institute Core Bioinformatics group](https://www.corebioinf.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/)? We are always excited to hear from applicants!

This repo contains [an analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Core-Bioinformatics/questionable-analysis/blob/main/cuomo-example.html) and [bulk mRNA-seq data](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Core-Bioinformatics/questionable-analysis/blob/main/yang-example.html) in which several questionable decisions have been made in the processing and analysis.

**Which parts of this analysis would you have done differently, and why?** Please email your thoughts to iim22 at cam.
